# Compiler_Lab_Tasks

In the compilation procedure, the Syntax analysis is the second stage. Here the provided input string is scanned for the validation of the structure of the standard grammar. Basically, in the second phase, it analyses the syntactical structure and inspects if the given input is correct or not in terms of programming syntax.

It accepts tokens as input and provides a parse tree as output. It is also known as parsing in a compiler.
